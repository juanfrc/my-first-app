<h1>10 Reasons to Start your Business</h1>

<p>Some people are destined to be entrepreneurs. From the time they get through school, or maybe even before that, they’re hungry to start a business and lead it to success, and they’ll stop at nothing to make that dream a reality. </p>

<p>For others, starting a business is a scary, intimidating notion. There are too many unknowns to take the plunge. But if you’re considering becoming an entrepreneur, don’t forget all the benefits that go along with it:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Flexibility. Work your own hours.</li>

	<li>More spare time (eventually). Spend more time with your family and friends. But note: This is only applicable once your business is established and you have employees handling the majority of necessary responsibilities. Don’t expect to have more spare time until you reach this point. In fact, expect to have much less.</li>

	<li>Call the shots. Nobody else is going to set the rules. You are.</li>

	<li>Set your own deadlines. No more last-minute rushing unless you want to do it.</li>

	<li>Sell how you want to sell. Online? In person? Inbound? Outbound? It’s your call.</li>

	<li>Create your own environment. You can set the formality and culture of your organization.</li>

	<li>Pursue your passion. You can do what makes you happy.</li>

	<li>Create something from scratch. Watch your organization grow from start to finish.</li>

	<li>Meet new people. Network with other entrepreneurs and professionals.</li>

	<li>Build a team. You decide who to hire and bring into your company.</li>
</ol>
